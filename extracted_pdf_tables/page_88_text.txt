The on-line print-out for
the
complete problem is included
herein.
First,
a
complete reproduction of the input data is printed, in
exactly the
same array
as
it is presented to the card punchers _
Since
a
calculation of keff
was
requested, this number is printed, followed by the
initial total kinetic energy, total internal energy and initial maximum
radius _
At time equal to zero,
a
short print-out is made, consise
of
Time,
Power, Alpha,
At and
W_
As the calculation progresses,
similar
short prints are repeated following each Sn calculation.
Dumps
are noted a8
occur
during the process_
When a "long" print-out is
in order (NH = 0
mod Np) first the
total energy, the kinetic
energy and
the checks
on the
energy
computation
are
printed_
This
is followed by a
detailed lis
of the density, radius,
velocity, pressure, internal energy and temperature of each mas8 point.
This latter print-out i8 time-consuming; hence, the program
wa8 revised
to permit infrequent or-line,
prints_
coupled with frequent off-line,
long prints _
The latter
are
dumped
on
tape and
are available for off-line
]
print-out on separate equipment, if needed.
