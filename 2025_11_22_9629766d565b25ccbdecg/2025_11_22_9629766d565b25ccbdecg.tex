\section*{$A x-1$, A COMPUTING PROGRAM FOR COUPLED NEUTRONICS-HYDRODYNAMICS CALCULATIONS ON THE IBM-704 }


\section*{I. INTRODUCTION}
In connection with studies in the safety of fast reactors, it is necessary to calculate the energy yield and explosive force of a variety of hypothetical nuclear accidents. $(1,2)$ A valuable analytical technique for calculating such incidents was developed by Bethe and Tait, (3) and since modified by Jankus. $(1,2)$ To achieve an analytic solution, however, various simplifications and approximations were required, with consequent reduction of accuracy and applicability. A numerical solution, employing high speed digital computers, was needed to improve upon the accuracy available from the analytic solution and to provide a more flexible computational method. To gain this end most efficiently, the Argonne National Laboratory asked for and was granted the full cooperation of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. R. B. Lazarus, assisted by M. B. Wells, drew upon Los Alamos experience in the field of coupled neutronicshydrodynamics calculations to devise a program reasonably well suited to Argonne's needs. They collaborated closely with J. M. Cook, D. Okrent, and D. Satkus of ANL in the debugging of the original program. As operating experience was gained at ANL, some refinements in the sensitive control apparatus of the program were introduced at ANL, to provide improved accuracy and more efficient use of the computing machine. The program has not been fully optimized in every sense, however, and a reworking should make possible further increases in efficiency. The utilization and a very rough outline of a similar computing program have been given by Stratton, Colvin, and Lazarus, ${ }^{(4)}$ but no details of the code were presented.

Modification of Ax-1 to permit the use of other equations of state is under study. A special version designed to permit a study of the errors introduced by certain assumptions in the analytic technique is described in Appendix E, as Ax-1'.

The presentation to follow includes a very general outline of the program, a semi-detailed flow diagram which emphasizes the physics and control aspects of the calculation, and then a detailed flow diagram and listing of the program (which is written in Fortran). Explanatory notes accompany the diagrams.

Following the notes on the program, master lists detailing the roles of the sense switches, sense lights, pauses, and stops are presented. The operating instructions are then given, followed by a sample problem., including detailed information on input data.

The theoretical discussion has been kept primarily in the appendices, and is generally in outline form with references, rather than in full exposition.

\section*{II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM}
Given a spherically symmetric, super-prompt critical system, the program computes the variation in time and space of the specific energy, temperature, pressure, density, and velocity. As a function of time it computes the reactivity (in the form of alpha, the inverse period), the power, the total energy, and the position of the boundaries of the various shells into which the system has been subdivided. All delayed neutron effects are ignored, and no allowance is made for transfer of heat by conduction or radiation. The input information includes the initial reactivity or geometry, the initial velocities and temperatures of the mass points, the composition and disposition of materials, the appropriate equation of state constants, and the microscopic neutron cross sections.

For calculational purposes the spherical assembly is divided into a number of hypothetical spherical shells or mass points. The neutronics of this system is calculated in conventional fashion, using the $S_{n}$ method, $(5,6,7)$ thereby providing a power distribution across the radial network, as well as the alpha of the system.

$$

From the neutronics calculation one goes to the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics portion to calculate the variation of power, temperature, pressure, density, and velocity with time. One may characterize the overall arrangement by means of the following block diagram.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-010}

The calculation proceeds initially like the usual $S_{n}$ calculation. After computing average cross sections for each of the spherical shells, in the mixture code, the program proceeds either to a calculation of alpha $\left(=\frac{k_{e x}}{\ell}\right)$ for the specified configuration, or to a scaling of the reactor radii to provide the alpha originally specified. Before proceeding to the hydrodynamics the code also computes $\mathrm{k}_{\text {eff }}$ for the initially converged configuration, if so requested.

The neutronics portion of the program is always done in the $\mathrm{S}_{4}$ approximation. It supplies to the succeeding portions of the program the alpha corresponding to that specific configuration. It also supplies a relative power distribution, to be used in assigning the increase in energy within each spherical shell or mass point, while this configuration remains a reasonable approximation.

The program proceeds into the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic portions. For one or more short time intervals, $\Delta t$, alpha is considered to remain constant while the power varies as $e^{\alpha \Delta t}$. From the pressure gradients in the system the average accelerations of the mass points are computed and, hence, the new velocities at the end of a time interval. These, in turn, lead to the new radial positions of each shell boundary at the end of a time interval. The solution is performed in a Lagrangian coordinate system, i.e., the mesh is embedded in the material, and follows it along throughout its motion.

During the time interval energy is added to the system (the average power times $\Delta t$ ) and this is distributed among the shells in accord with the previously calculated fission distribution. By allowing for the work done by or on a shell in expansion or compression, the net change in internal energy is computed, and from the internal energy a new pressure and temperature are obtained. In the $A x-1$ program, the relation between pressure and temperature has been taken to be linear, namely

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}}=\alpha \rho+\beta \theta+\tau
$$

while the specific heat at constant volume is given by

$$
\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{V}=A_{c v}+B_{c v} \theta
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{H} & =\text { pressure } \\
\rho & =\text { density } \\
\theta & =\text { temperature } \\
E & =\text { internal energy }
\end{aligned}
$$

The various coefficients are allowed to vary from shell to shell, but no provision is made for mixing several substances within a shell to generate average values of these coefficients, as with cross sections.

The thermodynamic equations are solved using an iterative procedure, guessing the new pressure at each mass point to be the old pressure for the first iteration. The so-called viscous pressure, a mathematical procedure devised by von Neumann and Richtmyer (see Reference 8 and Appendix C) is included to permit thermodynamic and hydrodynamic calculations in the presence of a steep shock front. Hence, the total pressure is the sum of the hydrodynamic pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}}$, and the synthetic viscous pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{V}}$.

When calculation of the thermo- and hydro-dynamic changes during the time interval $\Delta t$ is complete (a hydrocycle), a series of tests are run, and the program either proceeds with another hydrocycle or goes back to the neutronics calculation.

To control the pace of a problem, the code continually examines the magnitude or rate of change of certain crucial parameters, and varies

$$

the $\Delta t$ of a hydrocycle or the number of hydrocycles per neutron cycle accordingly. This latter number begins at unity and is allowed to build up gradually if the forces present are not changing alpha too rapidly or modifying the density of a mass point radically. When the power variation in a hydrocycle, or the change in alpha between neutron cycles, gets so large as to damage the accuracy of the solution, the pace of the calculation is slowed automatically - or stopped in extreme cases.

\section*{III. LIST OF SYMBOLS AND DEFINITION OF TERMS}
The program is written in Fortran, forcing a symbolic notation consistent with the requirements of the Fortran system and not always identical to customary physical usage. Hence, a dual list of symbols follows, that on the left comprising the Fortran symbols in alphabetical order. There is generally an associated physical symbol next to it, together with a translation or definition of the pair. In the explanation which follows, the physical symbol will generally be used.

The system of units used in the calculation is somewhat different from that conventionally used by the reactor physicist, so a brief discussion is given.

The basic choice for mass, length, time, and temperature is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
unit of mass = grams
unit of length = cm
unit of time = μsec
unit of temperature = kev
\end{verbatim}

Then, it follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { the unit of velocity }=\mathrm{cm} / \mu \mathrm{sec} \\
& \text { the unit of acceleration }=\mathrm{cm} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2} \\
& \text { the unit of force }=\mathrm{gm} \mathrm{~cm} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2}\left(=10^{12} \mathrm{dynes}\right) \\
& \text { the unit of energy }=\mathrm{gm} \mathrm{~cm}{ }^{2} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2}\left(=10^{12} \mathrm{ergs}\right) \\
& \text { the unit of power }=\mathrm{gm} \mathrm{~cm}{ }^{2} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{3}\left(=10^{12} \mathrm{ergs} / \mu \mathrm{sec}\right) \\
& \text { the unit of pressure }=\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mu \mathrm{sec}^{2 \cdot} \mathrm{~cm}^{12}}\left(=10^{12} \frac{\mathrm{~cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{gm} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}}\right. \\
& \text { the unit of specific heat }=\frac{\mathrm{gm}^{2}}{\mu \mathrm{sec}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{kev}}
\end{aligned}

}\section*{IV. DISCUSSION OF CONTROLS OF THE PROGRAM}
The course of the solution and many of the controls thereon are explained in this section with the aid of a flow diagram. Details of the $S_{n}$ calculation, the mixture code, and various other aspects not directly pertinent to this area of understanding are left for a later section covering the entire program step by step. Order numbers corresponding to various sequences of events are usually indicated in the upper right hand corner of the boxes in the flow diagram. It is cautioned that at times steps have been omitted to simplify an explanation.

The first illustration outlines the steps followed at the start of a problem.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-027}

The $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{n}}$ calculation (or Big G Loop) is treated like a black box in this section. It is noted that the problem originator can request the computing machine to scale the radii to provide some initial alpha. Also, the machine will calculate and print the $k_{e f f}$ of the initially converged configuration if so requested, enabling a determination of the neutron lifetime, $\ell=K_{\mathrm{ex}} / \alpha$.

When the $S_{n}$ calculation has converged, the program begins to exercise control on $\Delta t$, the time interval, as follows.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-028}\\

Thus, if $\alpha \Delta \mathrm{t}$, the fractional change in power per hydrocycle, is too great in the original specification, $\Delta t$ is reduced. At Order 9014, further controls are exercised following all neutronics calculations except the first.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-028(1)}

In this sequence the last two alphas are compared to see if alpha is changing too slowly or too rapidly between successive $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{n}}$ calculations. If the difference is very small, $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$, the number of hydrocycles per neutron cycle, is increased by one. This number starts at unity and slowly builds up during a typical burst where a step function of reactivity is inserted at very low power. The program then sends the computation to Order 9050 to begin a hydrocycle. If the difference in alphas, compared to the maximum alpha encountered, exceeds $\eta_{3}$ but not $3 \eta_{3}$, the hydrocycle begins unless the operator had decided, based on observation of the output, that $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ should be reduced. In this case he turns on (or depresses) Sense Switch No. 5, which reduces $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ by one before performing the hydrocycle. If $3 \eta_{3}$ is exceeded, $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ is reduced by one and the comparison is again made, this time with the upper limit, $6 \eta_{3}$. If this is not exceeded, the hydrocycle proceeds. If it is, $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ is set all the way back to unity before the hydrocycle begins. However, if $N_{S} 4$ was already unity when $3 \eta_{3}$ was exceeded, sense light No. 3 is turned on before beginning the hydrocycle. Following the cycle, the time interval $\Delta t$ will be halved, since there is no further recourse to $N_{S 4}$ to control the variation in alpha between successive $S_{n}$ calculations.

We continue from 9050.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-029}

In this last set of steps control is exercised on the density change occurring in any volume element in a single hydrocycle. If it is too great, $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ is halved. Or, if the motion of one radial boundary should be so great as to cross the next boundary, the time interval is also halved. The presence of these serious difficulties in the course of the solution is printed on the output for the benefit of the operator.

The viscous pressure is a mechanism devised to permit calculation without the ordinary difficulties which would accompany the passage of strong shock waves. (See Appendix C).\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-030}

In this sequence a criterion for stability of the calculation is computed which is designed to prevent the generation of excessively high changes in density per hydrocycle. The criterion, $W$, will be examined later in the program. The controls then ask a series of questions designed to exercise a control on the rate of change of alpha per neutronics cycle during the peak of the burst. Not wishing to keep $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ small during the low power portion, a test is installed to reduce $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ when the rate of change of alpha becomes significant. (See Appendix A).

From Order 9210, the program goes on to a pair of checks on the numerical accuracy of the computation. First the internal energy at each mass point is computed in an alternate fashion and compared with the previous calculation. Second, the sum of kinetic and internal energies is computed and compared with $Q$.\\

Following the check on numerical accuracy, which is merely printed out for the information of the problem originator, a series of questions are asked to determine whether the time interval $\Delta t$ is appropriate. If $W$, the stability function, is larger than $0.3, \Delta t$ is halved ( 9285 , 9290). If the fractional change of power per cycle, $\alpha \Delta t$, exceeds $4 \eta_{2}, \Delta t$ is halved, assuming the stability test has not already done so $(9284,9290)$. If the problem has gone through $\mathrm{NL}_{\text {Max }}$ hydrocycles since the last doubling of $\Delta \mathrm{t}$, and if W and $\alpha \Delta \mathrm{t}$ are sufficiently small, $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ is doubled.

When the above tests are completed $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4 \mathrm{R}}+1 \rightarrow \mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{S} 4 \mathrm{R}+1}$ and if $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4 \mathrm{R}}<\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$, a new hydrocycle is begun at Order 9050. Otherwise, a final series of controls is exercised before sending the problem back to the neutronics cycle (8009).\\

This last series of tests is devised to reduce the number of timeconsuming neutronics calculations after the burst when $\alpha$ has turned negative and the power has fallen to a low value. This can also be taken as a signal to the operator to terminate the problem if there is no desire to study post-burst phenomena.

\section*{V. DETAILED FLOW DIAGRAM AND EXPLANATORY NOTES}
\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 1}
Since there are many possible reasons for wishing to rerun a portion of a previous problem, or extending a solution timewise, a provision has been made for starting up a problem anew from a previous dump. Automatic dumping on tape at regular intervals is provided (Order No. 9263) to facilitate such procedures. Sense switch No. 1 provides the operator the opportunity to alter the memory when rerunning a problem from the middle. It also enables one to use the proper precautions when working from a consolidated tape. (The term "on" is used in the flow diagrams to indicate a switch is "depressed.")

\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 2}
As mentioned previously, the problem originator can specify a configuration and take the starting alpha which accompanies it, or can specify an alpha, guess a configuration, and let the program vary all radii linearly to achieve this alpha before beginning the hydrodynamics solution. If\\

If ICNTRL is unity, the guessed outer radius goes to $\alpha_{4}$; as the calculation progresses, the successively adjusted values of $R$ (IMAX) are compared for the test of convergence, and a special convergence criterion, $\epsilon_{R}$ is used.

A complete on-line print-out of input data is normally obtained at the beginning of a new problem. This can be prevented to save machine time by turning on Sense Switch No. 6. There is no provision for off-line print-out of input data at the present time.

Notes on Sheet No. 3

The following is an elaboration of the procedure for calculating mixtures.

Each of the $\mathrm{N}_{\max }$ substances is assigned a number $\mathrm{N}=1,2, \ldots$, $\mathrm{N}_{\max }$. For each such N a set of cross section tables is read in.

If $M_{\max }=0$, there is no mixing to be performed and the mixture code is by-passed.

Otherwise, for the integers $M=1,2, \ldots, M_{\max }$, in that order, the computer mixes substances numbered $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{M}, 1}, \mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{M}, 2}, \ldots, \mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{M}, \mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{M}}}$ in the proportions $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{M}, 1}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{M}, 2}, \ldots, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{M}, \mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{M}}}$ (atom fraction) and assigns this new mixture the number $N_{M, i_{M}+1}$ where $i_{M}$ is the smallest integer such that $N_{M, i_{M}+2}=0$.

Each region is assigned its material label K , that of the material of which it is composed.

Input functions of mixture numbers (ROLAB (N), ALPHA (N), ..., BCV (N); see (7110),) must be (see (7080) to (7120)) read in that order of mixture numbers obtained by starting from the mesh point $I=2$ and recording each $N=K$ (I) as it appears (if it has not appeared before).

\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 4}
To expedite the preparation of this over-all program an existing $S_{4}$ program in Fortran was borrowed and tied into the over-all calculation. This calculation employs cross sections in barns and uses a material density in atoms/cc. Since the hydrodynamics calculation requires a density in grams/cc, it was necessary to employ more than one definition of density. The method used is as follows:

RO (I) is the hydrodynamic density, $\rho_{\mathrm{Hyd}}(\mathrm{I}), \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cc}$.\\
RHO (I) is the neutronic density, $\rho_{\text {neut }}(\mathrm{I})$, atoms $/ \mathrm{ccx} 10^{-24}$

ROLAB $M$ is a conversion factor between the two previous quantities ( $\rho_{\mathrm{Hyd}}=\rho_{\mathrm{lab}} \cdot \rho_{\text {neut }}$ ), and equals the average grams/atom $\times 10^{24}$ for mixture M .

If the problem originator sets KCNTRL equal to unity, he is requesting the value of $k_{e f f}$ corresponding to the original configuration, or alpha. The program is arranged to converge first on alpha, then to set KCALC equal to unity and send the computation back to Order No. 8000 to rebegin the Big G loop. The test for KCALC then routes the solution away from the alpha solution to the convergence test on keff.

The $S_{4}$ calculation itself is conventional $(5,6,7)$ except for a slight variation in the manner of iterating or achieving convergence. This is similar to the approach adopted in reference 6 (pgs. 11, 21) in that the various sums are performed with a semi-empirical weight function, $\mathrm{WN}(\mathrm{I})=\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{I}) \cdot\left(\sum_{\mathrm{g}=1}^{6} \mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{g}}(\mathrm{I})\right)$ (Order No. 8301) rather than merely a volume term $T(I)$. (See Order No. 301, for example, defining $\overline{F E^{\prime}}$.) The procedure used for calculating the next $\alpha$ is identical to that in reference 6. For the convergence on radius or $k_{e f f}$, however, the sums of weighted fissions and elastic collisions are employed in a somewhat different manner.

Notes on Sheet No. 8

Under Order No. 6801 the initial values of $k_{\text {eff }} 1,2,3,4$ are arranged to insure a minimum of four iterations before convergence of the $k_{e f f}$ calculation.

Under Order No. 6810, when $\mathrm{NH}=0$ the Lagrangian coordinates $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (I) are computed. These are time independent and serve throughout the problem when the mass of a mass point is needed to calculate the total value of a quantity at a mass point from the value per gram. They are also used in the calculation of acceleration, at the beginning of the I loop (below Order No. 9066).

\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 9}
Since the simple linear equation of state is generally not adequate over the entire temperature range, and since one frequently wishes to provide a threshold temperature above which the steep rise in pressure begins, the equation of state may yield negative pressures for low temperatures. In this event Order No. 6833 substitutes zero for the hydrodynamic pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}}$.

The constants $\epsilon_{0}$ (I) are discussed in Appendix D. They are utilized in an accuracy check involving an energy balance. Running $\mathrm{E}_{\text {kinetic }}$, $E_{\text {kinetic }}$ and $E_{\text {internal }}$ are normally lacking in the factor $\frac{4 \pi}{3}$ which is sup- plied directly before printout.

The outer boundary of the system is a free surface with zero pressure. This is accomplished mathematically by defining the pressure at the center of the next (fictitious) mass point as the negative of the pressure at the center of the outermost true mass point.

Notes on Sheet No. 10

The three quantities $Q, Q^{\prime}$ and $Q_{p}$ are defined as follows.\\
At the beginning of a new hydrocycle the energy $Q$ (less a factor $\frac{4 \pi}{3}$ ) is stored as $Q^{\prime}$, the energy after the previous increment in time. The new $Q$ is then calculated by adding in the energy rise during the present time increment. Thus the primed quantity is always the one previous in time. $Q_{p}$ is " $Q$ to be printed," i.e., $Q$ multiplied by the $\frac{4 \pi}{3}$ factor.

\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 11}
The new hydrocycle begins with a calculation of the new velocity and requires a new acceleration. From Appendix $B$ we see that the velocity at time $(n+1 / 2) \Delta t$ is computed using the acceleration at time $(n) \Delta t$. We may write 9 (Chapt. 10)

$$
U^{n+\frac{1}{2}}(I)=U^{n-\frac{1}{2}}(I)-\Delta t \frac{1}{\rho_{H y d}} \frac{\partial P_{H}}{\partial R}
$$

The Lagrangian coordinates, $R_{L}$, are defined by the relation $\rho R^{2} d R=R_{L}^{2} d R_{L}$, so that

$$
\frac{1}{\rho}=\frac{\mathrm{R}^{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{L}}^{2}} \frac{\partial \mathrm{R}}{\partial \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{L}}}
$$

Thus,

$$
U^{n+\frac{1}{2}}(I)=U^{n-\frac{1}{2}}(I)-\Delta t \frac{R^{2}}{R_{L}^{2}} \frac{\partial P_{H}}{\partial R_{L}}
$$

or

$$
U^{n+\frac{1}{2}}(I)=U^{n-\frac{1}{2}}(I)-\frac{\Delta t R^{2}(I)}{R_{L}^{2}(I)} \cdot \frac{P_{H}(I+1)-P_{H}(I)}{\frac{1}{2}\left[R_{L}(I+1)-R_{L}(I-1)\right]}
$$

On a diagram in space, these variables are located as follows:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-036}

The calculation of the new density, $\rho_{\text {Hyd }}^{T}$, follows directly from the definition of the Lagrangian coordinates.

Below Order No. 9082, the question "Is $\Delta \mathrm{V}<0$ ?" is asked to determine whether a compression or rarefaction wave is traversing that mass point. For a compression, the viscous pressure is computed and added to the true hydro-pressure, as explained in Appendix C.

An iterative procedure called the modified Euler method is used in the pressure calculation. At Order No. 9124 the previous pressure is guessed to be the answer at the next time interval. The temperature is calculated from energy considerations, and then a new pressure is calculated using the equation of state. This pressure is compared with the first guess, and if sufficiently different is used as the next guess. This subcycle is then repeated. In the convergence test (Order No. 9150) $\epsilon_{1}$ is a small pressure to provide some denominator if $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}}=0$. It should be negligible compared to PH at the values of interest.

The thermodynamic considerations are presented in Appendix D. A different equation of state could be used with appropriate changes in the program.

\section*{Notes on Sheet No. 12}
The VJ-OK test, included to provide more frequent calculation of alpha when alpha starts to change rapidly under pressure buildup, is\\
discussed in Appendix A. With Order No. 9213 the number of hydrocycles between off-line prints can be reduced at this point in the computations, thereby providing more frequent detailed results.

Notes on Sheet No. 13

The error checks are discussed in Appendix D. Briefly, the internal energy of each mass point is computed in an alternate manner and compared to that resulting from the normal procedure. Similarly, the total energy is computed in an alternate fashion and a comparison made.

Notes on Sheet No. 15

The reasons for the different shifts in $\Delta t$ and $\Delta t^{\prime}$ when the time interval is halved or doubled are discussed in Appendix B.\\

\section*{VII. ROLE OF SENSE SWITCHES, SENSE LIGHTS AND FLAGS}
\section*{Sense Switch No. 1}
At Order No. 7010, this switch, if on (depressed), calls for Pause 111 to allow time for modifications in a problem being rerun from a dump. Again at Order 9000, depressing this switch produces Pause 11111 after the print-out of input data and before the beginning of the mixture code. Finally, at Order 9230, if this switch is depressed, an on-line and off-line print-out of $t, Q_{p}$, power, alpha, etc., is provided independent of whether $N H \equiv 0 \bmod N_{p}$.

\section*{Sense Switch No. 2}
At Order No. 9262, depressing this switch produces a dump of the memory on Tape 6.

\section*{Sense Switch No. 3}
At Order No. 503, following Order No. 915, depressing this switch provides an on-line print-out of the radii and of ENN(I,J), the angular flux distribution for Group 1, the lowest energy group (or, in a one-group problem, the only group).

\section*{Sense Switch No. 4}
At Order No. 915, depressing this switch provides an on-line printout of $F(I)$, the fission source, for all mass points and of $E N(I G, I)$, the flux, for all groups and mass points.

\section*{Sense Switch No. 5}
At Order No. 9015, depressing this switch sends the computation to Order No. 9023 where $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ is reduced by one if it is not already unity.

\section*{Sense Switch No. 6}
At Order No. 7150, this switch bypasses the normal on-line printout of input data if depressed. At Order No. 9050, this switch, if depressed, produces Pause 66666 before beginning the next series of hydrocycles.

\section*{Sense Light No. 1}
At Order No. 9210, if this sense light is on, an energy balance is made and an on-line and off-line print-out of $t, Q_{p}$, power, $\alpha, \Delta t$, etc. is provided, independent of whether $\mathrm{NH}=0 \bmod \mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{p}}$. This light is lit at Order No. 9290 where $\Delta t$ is halved.

\section*{Sense Light No. 2}
At Order No. 9281, if the course of the problem permits a doubling of $\Delta t$, this sense light is lit. It is automatically turned off at Order No. 9220 following the next hydrocycle.

\section*{Sense Light No. 3}
At Order No. 9255, this sense light, if on, sends the computation to Order Nos. 9283 and 9290 where $\Delta t$ will be halved. The light will be turned on at Order No. 9025 if the fractional change in alpha between the last two $\mathrm{S}_{4}$ calculations exceeds $3 \eta_{3}$.

\section*{Sense Light No. 4}
At Order No. 2005, if the burst has gone through its peak and has reached a condition of negative alpha and low power, sense light No. 4 is lit and the fact that this condition has been attained is printed.

\section*{Flag 1}
If alpha becomes negative after having been positive, and if the tal energy shows no change or a net decrease during the hydrocycle, this flag sends $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S} 4}$ to 30,000 (Order Nos. 9017, 9062, 9065) terminating any further $S_{n}$ calculations. At this condition the burst is over, the power is essentially zero. The total energy may therefore actually not change (within limits of accuracy), and approximations in the solution might even produce a slight wavering in an essentially constant quantity.

\section*{VIII. LIST OF PAUSES AND STOPS}
Order No.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
7010 & Pause 7010 & This is a dummy pause to provide an address in memory where a transfer to the tape recall routine must be placed. If the problem is being run from restart, the dump numbered ICRNBR is read from tape into memory at this time. \\
\hline
7015 & Pause 111 & Optional pause (Sense Switch No. 1) to allow modification of memory or any other steps when beginning problem from a dump. \\
\hline
9002 & Pause 11111 & Optional pause (Sense Switch No. 2) following print-out of input data. \\
\hline
14 & Pause 14 & If $H(I)$ should be negative, this pause results. When problem is continued, $H(I)$ is set equal to zero. \\
\hline
900 & Stop 13571 & The problem is stopped if I < 0 results somehow. \\
\hline
901 & Stop 12345 & The problem is stopped if $\mathrm{J}=0$, falling outside the proper range $1-5$. \\
\hline
9051 & Pause 66666 & This is an optional pause (Sense Switch No. 6) at the beginning of the hydrocycle. \\
\hline
9068 & Pause 50 & This pause occurs after continuing from Pause 60, or if excessive change occurs in $\rho \underset{\mathrm{Hyd}}{\mathrm{T}}|\Delta \mathrm{V}|$, both serious troubles. Continuing the problem leads to dummy pause 9069. \\
\hline
9069 & Dummy Pause & If the problem is continued after Pause 50, Order No. 9069 institutes a dummy pause to provide an address in memory where a transfer to the tape recall routine must be placed. The latest dump of the problem is read from tape into memory at this time. The problem then continues with $\Delta t$ halved. \\
\hline
9080 & Pause 60 & This pause indicates radii crossing. Continuing the problem leads to Pause 50. \\

9170 & Pause 11 & If the hydrocycle calculation of the new pressure, an iterative process, does not converge as requested in 300 cycles, (Nit Max) Pause 11 results. On continuing the problem, the last calculated pressure is accepted as correct. \\
\hline
9265 & Pause 22222 & This pause follows Order No. 9262, where if Sense Switch No. 2 is on, a dump of the memory is called for, even though $\mathrm{N}_{\text {dump }}>0$. \\
\hline
9263 & Dummy Pause & This is a dummy pause to provide the address in memory where a transfer to the tape dump routine must be placed. The contents of the memory are written on Tape 5 at this time. \\

\section*{IX. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS}
Deck Composition:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The FORTRAN compiled binary deck with the transfer card removed and $170_{8}$ punched in row 12 L of the fourth card instead of the usual $140_{8}$ - 255 cards.
  \item The "Tape Dump and Recall Routine" - 1 card. (See Appendix F.1)
  \item Binary correction cards (transfers to the "Tape Dump and Recall Routine") - 3 cards.
  \item Transfer card $170_{8}-1$ card.
  \item Input data cards.
\end{enumerate}

Reader: 72-72 board.

Punch: Not used.\\

Printer: SHARE board No. 2.

Tapes: No. 5 should be blank for routine memory dumps and No. 6 should be blank for output.

Sense Switch Settings: Normally all switches are up. See the section on Sense Switches for details.

Underflow Switch: On

Running Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ready the card deck in the reader.
  \item Ready the printer.
  \item Mount and ready tapes No. 5 and 6.
  \item Clear and load cards.
\end{enumerate}

Program Stops:\\
$51_{8}$ This occurs if memory and tape transmission differ in the Tape Dump and Recall Routine portion of the program. Continuing will cause the tape unit to backspace one record and come to stop 52.

528 This occurs after the tape has been backspaced one record. Continuing will cause another attempt to execute the "Tape Dump and Recall Routine."

Since this is a FORTRAN compiled program the stops listed under the section "Error Stops in Object Program" of the FORTRAN Preliminary Operator's Manual are applicable. For additional stops see the section on Pauses.

Problem Termination:

The program does not terminate itself. Unless one wishes to observe post-burst pheonomena, the appearance of "Power Small NS4 Up" on the on-line output indicates a good stopping point. Tape No. 6 should be printed off-line under program control. Tape No. 5 should be saved if restarting the problem from a dump is anticipated (see Appendix F.2). Neither tape has an end-of-file on it.

Restart Procedure:

To restart a problem from a dump, follow the same procedure as for a new problem with the following exceptions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tape No. 5 should contain the dump.
  \item Input data consist only of a title card and an IRCNBR card containing the number of the dump from which restart is desired.
\end{enumerate}

Running Time:

The sample problem ran for 40 minutes before being terminated.

\section*{X. SAMPLE PROBLEM}
\section*{A. Input Data}
The specification of the problem will be made here in three different forms, all equivalent. First, a set of notes, as might be prepared by a physicist will be presented. The same problem will then be shown on the standard input sheets in slightly more cryptic fashion. Finally, the same data will be listed on the input sheet used by the card puncher in a form similar to that in which it is printed out.

A few general comments precede this presentation. It is first noted that the mass point $I=$ unity is always reserved for the central point, $R=0$, and the first real mass point and the first non-zero radius corresponds to $I=2$.

It is noted that cross sections are stored in barns, necessitating the use of different "densities" in the neutronics and hydrodynamics equations, as was discussed previously in the section "Detailed Flow Diagram and Explanatory Notes." It is also necessary that mixtures be

$$

specified as atomic fractions, $P_{i}$, where $\sum_{i} P_{i}=1$.

It is noted that in the section "Properties of Materials" a material should be listed only once, even if it reappears as one moves outward radially.

The size of the various convergence and comparison criteria specified herein are subject to revision in accordance with the needs and peculiarities of the problem. They generally represent a compromise between the need for accuracy and the desire to minimize the machine time consumed.

EPSR, EPSA, and EPSK are the convergence criteria for the various types of $S_{n}$ calculations. Running time will be particularly sensitive to EPSA, since this number controls the oft-repeated alpha calculation. ETA 2 limits the maximum fractional change in power per hydrocycle. Once set, it implies an inverse relationship between the initial alpha and the initial $\Delta t$. Unless conditions dictate otherwise, it is reasonable to choose the largest initial $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ which satisfies the ETA 2 test.\\
$\triangle \mathrm{t}_{\text {Max }}$, NP, NPOFF, and NPOFFP do not directly affect accuracy and, hence, are somewhat arbitrary, depending on the wishes of the problem initiator. ETA l and ETA 3 control the accuracy of the solution and, hence, must represent a balance between accuracy and machine time. As with many of the other control criteria, experience and subjective judgment play a major role in fixing these parameters. The numbers used in the test problem have been satisfactory for studies on accidents in fast reactors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Physicist's Specifications
\end{enumerate}

Problem: Geneve 10 Rerun March 20, 1959. Ax-1\\
Specify initial alpha $=0.013084 \mu \mathrm{sec}^{-1}$. Vary radii to fit.\\
Two region problem (Spherical core surrounded by concentric blanket).

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Core radius & 23.75 cm \\
Blanket radius & 44.70 cm \\
Core Density & $7.92 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cc}$ \\
Blanket Density & $15.83 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cc}$ \\
Core composition &  \\
$\quad$ (atomic fraction) & 0.36 Substance 1 \\
 & 0.64 Substance 2 \\
Blanket composition & 1.0 Substance 3 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Use 25 uniformly spaced mass points in core, 14 mass points in blanket.\\
All mass points initially at rest.\\
Core temp. $=10^{-4} \mathrm{kev}$.\\
Blanket temp. $=5 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{kev}$.\\
No fission in blanket. Guess smooth flux curve in core with edge to center ratio $=0.4$. Initial power $=10^{12} \mathrm{ergs} / \mu \mathrm{sec}$.\\
Use 1 group cross sections\\
$\mathrm{Vg}=1.695 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~cm} / \mu \mathrm{sec}$.\\
Substance $1=\mathrm{U}^{235}$\\
Substance $2=\mathrm{U}^{238}$\\
Substance $3=\mathrm{U}^{238}$ with no fission allowed.\\
Equation of State Parameters

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{P}=\alpha \rho+\beta \theta+\tau \\
& \alpha=.02873 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2} \\
& \beta=278.46 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm} \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

For core, set $\tau=-0.3946$. Then the pressure calculated from equation of state will be negative for the original density until $\theta=6 \times 10^{-4}$ kev. Program will keep pressure zero until this threshold temperature is reached.

For blanket, set $\tau=-0.4687189$, so that pressure initially is exactly zero from the equation of state.

Specific heat parameters:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}=A_{C V}+B_{C V} \theta \\
& A_{C V}=12.163 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2} \mathrm{kev} \\
& B_{C V}=5.78 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mu \mathrm{sec}^{2} \mathrm{kev}^{2}

Label the substances with the integers 1, 2, … … Max\\
Label the mixtures with the integers $N \operatorname{Max}+1, N \operatorname{Max}+2, N \operatorname{Max}+M \operatorname{Max}$\\
If N Max +M Max > 8, some mixtures must be stored at positions previously occupied by substances, wiping out all knowledge of those substances at the time the mixtures are stored therein. The maximum number of materials is 8 .

The proportions, $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{M}, \mathrm{IS})$, are stated as atomic fractions, and add up to unity for each mixture.

\section*{B. Results}
The on-line print-out for the complete problem is included herein. First, a complete reproduction of the input data is printed, in exactly the same array as it is presented to the card punchers. Since a calculation of $k_{\text {eff }}$ was requested, this number is printed, followed by the initial total kinetic energy, total internal energy and initial maximum radius.

At time equal to zero, a short print-out is made, consisting of Time, Qp , Power, Alpha, $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ and W . As the calculation progresses, similar short prints are repeated following each $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{n}}$ calculation. Dumps are noted as they occur during the process.

When a "long" print-out is in order ( $\mathrm{NH} \equiv 0 \bmod \mathrm{~Np}$ ) first the total energy, the kinetic energy and the checks on the energy computation are printed. This is followed by a detailed listing of the density, radius, velocity, pressure, internal energy and temperature of each mass point. This latter print-out is time-consuming, hence, the program was revised to permit infrequent on-line, long prints, coupled with frequent off-line, long prints. The latter are dumped on tape and are available for off-line print-out on separate equipment, if needed.\\

\section*{DETAILS OF THE VJ-OK-1 TEST}
Before the addition of the VJ-OK-1 test to the program it was observed that in the typical problem having a step function reactivity input at zero time and low power, $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$ would build up appreciably by the time high power and the accompanying shutoff mechanism were reached. As a result alpha would change considerably from $S_{4}$ calculation to $S_{4}$ calculation during shutoff. Since alpha is held constant between such neutronic calculations, some error in the time variation of power would result.

It was desirable that $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$ be large before the burst to conserve machine time. A means of reducing its size at the beginning of the burst was needed. It was decided to obtain the necessary signal by observing $\ddot{\rho}$, the time rate of change of the reactivity inserted per unit time by the feedback mechanism. When the ratio $\frac{\ddot{\rho}}{\rho}$ became large, alpha would start changing rapidly and $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$ should be reduced.\\

Thus, in a power series expansion of reactivity,

$$
\rho=\rho_{0}+\dot{\rho} \Delta t+\frac{1}{2} \ddot{\rho}(\Delta t)^{2}+\ldots,
$$

the term in the second derivative is watched, and\\
when

$$
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \ddot{\rho}(\Delta \mathrm{t})^{2}}{\rho_{\text {initial }}}>\mathrm{OK}_{1}
$$

$\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$ is modified.\\
Equation 14 from Appendix C of reference 1 provides the relation

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{\rho} & =\frac{-5}{2.54} \frac{\sqrt{q}}{b} \int \ddot{u}\left(\frac{d \phi}{d r}\right)^{2} r d r \\
& =+\frac{5}{2.54} \frac{\sqrt{q}}{b} \int\left(\frac{1}{s} \frac{\partial p}{\partial r}\right)\left(-\frac{2 q r}{b^{2}}\right)^{2} r d r \\
& =\frac{5}{2.54} \frac{1}{s}\left(\frac{\sqrt{q}}{b}\right)^{5}\left[p r^{3}-p \cdot 3 r^{2} d r\right]_{\circ}^{\infty} \\
& =-\frac{20}{2.54} \frac{3}{s}\left(\frac{\sqrt{q}}{b}\right)^{5} \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int p r^{2} d r \cdot 4 \pi \\
& =\frac{-60}{10.16 \pi} \frac{1}{s}\left(\frac{\sqrt{q}}{b}\right)^{5} \int p d V
\end{aligned}
$$

where

\begin{verbatim}
\phi is the flux,
u is the displacement,
r is the radial position
p is the pressure, and
b, q, and s are defined below.
\end{verbatim}

Then

$$
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \ddot{\rho}(\Delta t)^{2}}{\rho_{\text {initial }}}=\frac{\left(N_{S_{4}}\right)^{2}(\Delta t)^{2}}{\rho_{\text {initial }}} \cdot \frac{30}{10.16 \pi}\left(\frac{\sqrt{q}}{b}\right)^{5} \frac{1}{s} \int p d V<{O K_{1}}^{.}
$$

Thus this ratio is proportional to a constant which is a function of the particular reactor, multiplied by the integral of the pressure over the reactor volume. This relation was derived by $V$. Jankus and has been previously reported in slightly different form in reference 2. (See equation \#23.)

The last equation may be rewritten in the form

$$
\mathrm{VJ} \cdot(\Delta \mathrm{t})^{2} \cdot\left(\mathrm{~N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}\right)^{2} \int \mathrm{pdv}<\mathrm{OK}_{1}
$$

where

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{VJ} & =\left(\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{q}}}{\mathrm{~b}}\right)^{5} \times \frac{1}{\rho_{\max ^{\mathrm{s}}}} \\
& =\left(\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{q}}}{\mathrm{~b}}\right)^{5} \times \frac{1}{\alpha_{\max } \cdot \ell \cdot \mathrm{s}}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

\begin{verbatim}
l-q = ratio of flux at core edge to center
b = core radius, cm
\alpha max = maximum alpha anticipated, }\delta\textrm{k}/\mu se
s = core density, grams/ cm}\mp@subsup{}{}{3
l = prompt neutron lifetime, \mu sec
\end{verbatim}

Generally OK-1 has been set equal to .01 . If the fractional change in reactivity in time $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$. $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ exceeds this amount, steps are taken to reduce $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}_{4}}$. To improve the efficiency of the over-all program, the test is not imposed until the local pressure at some point exceeds PTEST, an adjustable parameter.

\section*{APPENDIX B}
\section*{THE TIME SCALE}
The continuous time variable of the burst is approximated by a series of small, finite steps, $\Delta t$. From any point $t$ in the course of the solution, the time is given by $t+n \Delta t$, assuming constant time increments. A superscript notation is used herein to label other parameters which vary with time. Thus, the radius for mass point I may be written as $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{I})^{\mathrm{n}}, \mathrm{R}(\mathrm{I})^{\mathrm{n}+1}$, etc.

When the problem begins, the radii are specified at time $t=0$. Alpha is calculated for this configuration, so that alpha is known at $t=0$. The acceleration is calculated at this time, requiring a knowledge of the pressure (and hence the energy) at $t=0$. To find the radii at $t+\Delta t,\left(R^{n+1}\right)$ the average velocity during the interval of $\mathrm{U}^{n+1 / 2}$ is needed. This may be calculated, provided that $\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}-1 / 2}$ and the average acceleration during the time interval between $t+1 / 2 \Delta t$ are known.

To find the internal energy (and thus the pressure) at $t+\Delta t$ requires he internal energy at $t$, plus the average power during $\triangle t$, or $P O W E R^{n+1 / 2}$. The latter may be calculated from the power at $t-1 / 2 \Delta t$, and the average rate of rise during the period $t-\frac{\Delta t}{2}$ to $t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}$, ALPHA $^{n}$.

The positions in time at which the various variables must be computed are summarized in the following time chart.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
$\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}-1 / 2}$ & $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{I})^{\mathrm{n}}$ & $\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}+1 / 2}$ & $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{I})^{\mathrm{n}+1}$ & $\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}+3 / 2}$ & $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{I})^{\mathrm{n}+2}$ \\
\hline
POWER ${ }^{\text {n-1/2 }}$ & $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{n}}$ & POWER ${ }^{\mathrm{n}+1 / 2}$ & $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{n}+1}$ & POWER ${ }^{\text {n+3/2 }}$ & $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{n}+2}$ \\
\hline
 & $\Delta Q^{n}$ &  & $\Delta \mathrm{Q}^{\mathrm{n}+1}$ &  & $\Delta Q^{n+2}$ \\
\hline
 & $\mathrm{E}_{\text {internal }}^{\mathrm{n}}$ &  & $\mathrm{E}_{\text {internal }}$ &  & $\mathrm{E}_{\text {internal }}^{\mathrm{n}+2}$ \\
\hline
 & $\alpha^{\mathrm{n}}$ &  &  &  & $\alpha^{\mathrm{n}+2}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The time chart helps to explain the steps taken when $\Delta t$ is halved or doubled. When, as per order 9290, $\frac{\Delta t}{2} \rightarrow \Delta t$, one notes $\frac{3}{4} \Delta t^{\prime} \rightarrow \Delta t^{\prime}$. In the solution parameters specified on the half interval station change in accordance with $\Delta t^{\prime}$, while the others vary with $\Delta t$. Except during a change in time interval, $\Delta t^{\prime}=\Delta t$. At a time interval change, the variables $U$ and POWER\\
should be maintained at their half interval position. Thus, if at time $t+\Delta t$, the time interval is halved, the time chart for $R(I)$ and $U$ would look as follows.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-107(1)}\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-107(3)}\\

t\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_11_22_9629766d565b25ccbdecg-107}

Thus the time interval between $R(I)^{n+1}$ and $R(I)^{n+2}$ is half the old $\Delta t$, while the time interval between $\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}+1 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{n}+3 / 2}$ is $3 / 4$ the old $\Delta \mathrm{t}$. On the other hand, on a doubling of $\Delta t, \Delta t^{\prime}$ increases only by a factor of 1.5 . This arbitrary procedure maintains the velocities and radii in the proper relative positions. A small error in computation is produced in that during a halving of $\Delta t$, the increment in $U$ is computed using as average acceleration the value at $2 / 3$ the interval instead of midway.\\

\section*{APPENDIX C}
\section*{DISCUSSION OF HYDRODYNAMIC STABILITY CRITERIA AND SHOCK WAVE TREATMENT}
If $c$ is the velocity of sound in the material, then for stability of the finite-difference scheme c $\Delta t<\Delta R$ must hold. (See Ch. II, Sections 2 and 3 of reference (10); also, see Ch. X, Section 11, p. 221 of (9).)

Let $p=p(\rho, s)$ be the caloric equation of state, where $p$ is pressure, $\rho$ is density, and $s$ is specific entropy. Then $c^{2}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}$. (See (11), Ch. III, Section 35; or (12) p. 111, Section 6.10.) The material is treated as a polytropic gas, so that $p=f(s) \rho^{\gamma}$ and $\frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho}=\gamma \frac{p}{\rho}$, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic exponent. But $\frac{p}{\rho}=(\gamma-1) E$, where $E$ is the specific internal energy (see p. 7 of (11)), so that the stability criterion becomes $\left(\frac{\Delta \mathrm{R}}{\Delta \mathrm{t}}\right)^{2}>\gamma(\gamma-1) \mathrm{E}$. Then, if one defines a "Courant stability constant" by $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{sc}}=\gamma(\gamma-1), \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{sc}} \mathrm{E} \frac{(\Delta \mathrm{t})^{2}}{(\Delta \mathrm{R})^{2}}<1$ must hold.

Actually, the stronger criterion

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{sc}} \mathrm{E} \frac{(\Delta \mathrm{t})^{2}}{(\Delta \mathrm{R})^{2}}+4 \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{vp}} \frac{|\Delta \mathrm{~V}|}{\mathrm{V}}<.3
$$

is imposed. (When it fails, $\Delta t$ is halved.) The second term (due to George N. White, Jr.) will ordinarily dominate only in the vicinity of a shock. $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{vp}}$ is the "shock-width constant," and is usually taken to be between 1.5 and 2. It is related to the number of mesh-widths by which the shock is artificially broadened in the von Neumann-Richtmyer method for the numerical calculation of hydrodynamic shocks. (See Ref. 8, also Ref. 9, Chap. 10.) They add a fictitious "pseudo-viscosity pressure" $P_{v}=C_{v p \rho} \rho^{3}\left(\Delta R \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}\right)^{2}$ to the real physical pressure in all dynamical equations. This imitates the shocksmearing effect of ordinary physical viscosity, and the differential equations need not be interrupted by troublesome boundary conditions (given by the Rankine-Hugoniot equations) at moving surfaces of internal discontinuity.\\
$P_{V}$ is quadratic in $\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}$ so that the transition layer will have width independent of shock strength. (In the case of physical viscosity, the term is linear and the width goes to zero with increasing strength.) For further discussion of this method, see Ch. X, Sections 8-12, of (9).

\section*{APPENDIX D}
\section*{THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS}
The equation of state has been taken as

$$
p=\alpha \rho+\beta \theta+\tau
$$

with the accompanying relation

$$
\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{v}=c_{v}=A_{c v}+B_{c v} \theta
$$

The first law of thermodynamics provides the relation

$$
d E=d Q-p d v=\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{v} \partial \theta+\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial v}\right)_{\theta} \partial v
$$

Further thermodynamic considerations (Ref. 12, See Chap. XIII) lead to the additional relation,

$$
\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial v}\right)_{\theta}=\theta\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}\right)_{v}-p \text {. }
$$

Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
d \theta & =\frac{\left\{d E-\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial v}\right)_{\theta} d v\right\}}{\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{V}} \\
& =\frac{\left\{d E-\left[\theta\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}\right)_{V}-p\right] d v\right\}}{\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{V}} \\
& =\frac{d E+(\alpha \rho+\tau) d V}{A_{c v}+B_{c v} \theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

This leads to the formula under Order \#9130, which in effect reads

$$
\Delta \theta=\frac{\left\{\Delta E+\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\left[\rho^{n}+\rho^{n+1}\right]+\tau\right) \Delta v\right\}}{A_{c v}+\frac{B_{c v}}{2}\left(\theta^{n}+\theta^{n+1}\right)}
$$

For the alternate computation of energy a similar starting point is taken, namely,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial v}\right)_{\theta} & =\theta\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial \theta}\right)-p \\
& =-\frac{\alpha}{v}-\tau \text { for the assumed equation of state. }
\end{aligned}
$$

Integrating, one gets

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =-\alpha \ln v-\tau \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{f}(\theta) \\
& =\alpha \ln \rho-\frac{\tau}{\rho}+\mathbf{f}(\theta)

$$

Since $\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial \theta}\right)_{v}=C_{v}=\frac{\partial f(\theta)}{\partial \theta}$, integration of the specific heat equation, yields\\
the result

$$
f(\theta)=A_{c v} \theta+\frac{1}{2} B_{c v} \theta^{2}+E_{0},
$$

and thus

$$
\mathrm{E}=\alpha \ln \rho-\frac{\tau}{\rho}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{cv}} \theta+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~B}_{\mathrm{cv}} \theta^{2}+\mathrm{E}_{0}=\text { Running } \mathrm{E}_{\text {internal }}
$$

If

$$
\left.E]_{t=0}=A_{c v} \theta+\frac{1}{2} B_{c v} \theta^{2}\right]_{t=0}
$$

then

$$
\left.\mathrm{E}_{0}=\frac{\tau}{\rho}-\alpha \ln \rho\right]_{\mathrm{t}=0}
$$

The so-called error local is obtained by comparing the running $E_{\text {internal }}$, computed as above for each mass point with the value obtained at Order \#9180, which represents the sum of the initial energy and all the succeeding $\Delta E$ values resulting from the corresponding iterative solutions for pressure.

The second energy balance or "check" involves summing the kinetic and internal energies for all mass points and comparing it with the total energy $Q$, as determined directly from the integral of power over time.

\section*{POSSIBLE VARIATIONS IN THE PROGRAM - Ax-1'}
For Ax-1, a simple form of the equation of state was chosen, with the explicit intent of making modifications therein simple to accomplish. For example, another simple equation of state would be that employed by Bethe and Tait, ${ }^{(3)}{ }{ }{ }=(\gamma-1) \rho E_{\text {int }}$, wherein a direct calculation of temperature is bypassed, and a different dependence of pressure on density results. Considerably more elaborate equations might also be utilized. Work is continuing in this area to determine that form which might be most satisfactory for problems in fast reactor safety.

One modification of Ax-1 has already been made. It has been customary in previous analytical calculations to make a pair of partially compensating assumptions, for simplicity of analysis. (3) First, during the burst alpha was held constant up till the time sufficient reactivity had been inserted by the shut off mechanism to balance the input reactivity exactly. This procedure kept the power rising too fast. Secondly, the energy developed in the burst was computed up to this point of reactivity balance, neglecting that portion generated while the power fell from its peak during the time of negative alpha. To check the effect of these assumptions, Ax-1 was modified so that it followed the course of the explosion in the above manner. The power distribution at zero time was used as that valid for computing the distribution of energy. The $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{n}}$ section was allowed to go on computing new alphas, but they were used only to terminate the calculation when $\alpha<0$. The recomputed fluxes and alphas did not enter the hydrodynamic calculation. The computation was accomplished by the following list of modifications:\\
(1) Insert " $\mathrm{FOD}(40)$ " in dimension statements.\\
(2) Omit "POWNGL" from (7135) and from print statement.\\
(3) Insert "FBAR" = 0 after (7135)\\
"FALPHA = 0"\\
(4) In (9010) omit "FBAR = 0", and move up to insert the order "IF(NH)6800, 6800, 9014," now after (9011), in its place keeping the number (9010) for the moved order.

Move the two orders

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { "DO } 9011 \mathrm{I}=2, \mathrm{I} M A X \text { " } \\
& \text { "9011 FBAR }=\text { FBAR }+\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{I}) * \mathrm{~F}(\mathrm{I}) \text { " }
\end{aligned}
$$

down to just beyond 6800. Then insert "FALPHA" ALPHA"\\
(5) Just beyond (6835), insert FOD (I) $=\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{I}) / \mathrm{RO}(\mathrm{I})$\\
(6) In (9070), replace formula for DELQ by "DELQ $=$ FOD(I)*QBAR"\\
(7) Omit (9060) +1 through (9065).\\
(8) Omit " $Z=A L P H A$ * DELTP"

Insert" $Z=$ FALPHA * DELTP" from just before (9060).\\
(9) Between (9330) and (9337), take everything out and replace it by\\

\section*{Ax-1 TAPE DUMP AND RECALL ROUTINE}
A periodic dumping of the memory from $10000_{8}$ through $17777_{8}$ onto tape \#5 has been provided. In case of machine failure, lack of sufficient machine time to complete a problem, a desire to change control parameters, or a desire to continue past the original termination point, a previous dump can be selected and the problem continued from that point. The Tape Dump and Recall Routine occupies positions $140_{8}$ through $165_{8}$ in memory and is loaded by the FORTRAN loader. It was necessary to arrange transfers at appropriate addresses in the main body of the Ax-1 code to the above routine. This was accomplished by inserting at the addresses of formulas 7010 and 9069 a transfer to the tape recall portion of the routine and at the address of formula 9263 a transfer to the tape dump portion of the routine.

\section*{Ax-1 DUMP-TAPE CONSOLIDATION ROUTINE}
If many Ax-1 dump tapes are saved in anticipation of restarts, the accumulation of tapes can present problems. In order to have the dumps available and yet avoid keeping a large number of tapes, a routine to combine several tapes into one was written. This routine copies the dumps from individual problems onto one master dump tape, checking both the tape reading and writing processes. Cards for this routine are not included in the Ax-1 deck.\\
A. Operating Instructions:

Reader: $72 \times 72$ board.\\
Punch: Not used.\\
Printer: Not used.\\
Tapes: \#5-dump tape which is to be added to the consolidated tape. \#3-consolidated tape.\\
Sense Switches: Not used.\\
Running Procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Ready UA CSB1 Binary Card Loader (3 cards) followed by the Consolidation Routine Deck ( 4 cards) in the card reader.
  \item Mount and ready tapes \#5 and \#3.
  \item Clear and load cards.
  \item At stop 2668:\\
a. Enter into the decrement of the MQ the total number (in octal) of records (dumps) on tape \#5 to be saved.\\
b. Enter into the address of the MQ the total number (in octal) of records (dumps) already on tape \#3.\\
c. Press start.
  \item At stop $270_{8}$, tape \#5 has been completely copied onto tape \#3. If another tape is to be copied onto tape \#3, mount and set it at \#5 and follow instructions under 4, omitting step B.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Error Stops:}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
2458 & CKS error in reading tape \#5. Press start to try again. \\
\hline
$250_{8}$ & CKS error in writing or reading tape \#3. Press start to try reading tape \#3 again. If stop $250_{8}$ reoccurs, the error was in writing, not reading tape \#3. Press start again to recopy tape \#5 onto tape \#3. \\
\hline
$261_{8}$ & CKS error in writing tape \#3. Press start to try again. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{B. Comments on Dump Numbering:}
For a new problem, the dumps are numbered consecutively starting at one. The number of dumps on tape \#5 at the time the problem is terminated is equal to the last dump number printed in the on-line output.

For a problem restarted from dump number $M$, (but not from the consolidated tape), additional dumps are made on tape \#5 following dump M and numbered consecutively starting at $\mathrm{M}+1$. Therefore, the total number of dumps on tape \#5 at the time the problem is terminated is still equal to the last dump number printed in the on-line output.

For a problem restarted from the consolidated tape the dump number (IRCNBR) specified must be the number of the desired record on the consolidated tape, which is usually not the dump number of the specific problem. Therefore great care must be taken in keeping track of the location and the number of records on the consolidated tape. Reading in the dump replaces IRCNBR with the dump number of the specified problem. After the dump is completely read in from the consolidated tape, another blank tape should be set at 5 and the consolidated tape removed to avoid destroying dumps from other problems when getting new dumps from the problem being run. Also, it would be wise to manually set IRCNBR $=0$ at this time so that the dump numbers from the restarted problem will equal the record numbers on the new tape \#5. Depressing S.S. \#1 at the start of the problem will cause pause 111 which will enable these changes to be made.\\
